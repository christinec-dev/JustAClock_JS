# Just A Clock?

A couple of years ago I created a GitHub Profile that went by the name of WebacyByChristine. Since then, I've learnt a lot more when it comes to programming, but I still wanted to share my older projects that I did to learn the basics of Javascript (I also lost my email address since then, oops!). This is a just a clock, yep, an app that displays the time. That's all it does. I made it with Javascript, and honestly, it's a good time passer just to stare at it when you're bored.
